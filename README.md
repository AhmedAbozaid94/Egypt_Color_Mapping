# Egypt_Color_Mapping
Egypt Color-Mapping using CSP Algorithm &amp; BackTracking search Algorithm 

#### Imported Modules 
- geopandas 
- matplotlib.pylot
- networkx
#### Details
- Using geopandas to read a shapefile with the all the coordinates of Egypt 
- I used Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm to make sure adjacent regions doesn't have the same Color 
- Then used BackTracking Search Algorithm 
- Used matplotlib to plot all the coordinates as a map 
- also used netowrkx Library to make a network Graph for all the Governorates colored
